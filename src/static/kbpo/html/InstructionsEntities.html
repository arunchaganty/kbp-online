<h3> Examples </h3>
<ul>
  <li><span class="mention PER"><b>People</b></span>: 
    <span class="mention TITLE">Deputy foreign minister</span>
    <span class="mention PER">Nasser Kamel</span> has summoned ...,
    <span class="mention PER">The minister</span> said <span class="mention PER">his</span> meeting is not unusual. <i>Note that you <b>do not need to identify unnamed people</b>, e.g. "Three policemen" were found at the scene.</i>  
  </li>
  <li><span class="mention ORG"><b>Organization</b></span>: 
    <span class="mention ORG">Department of Homeland Security</span> (<span class="mention ORG">DHS</span>)...,
    ... ruling Islamic party <span class="mention ORG">Ennahdha</span> ..., 
    ... the <span class="mention ORG">Philippine government</span>.
  </li>

  <li><span class="mention GPE"><b>City/State/Country</b></span>: 
    summoned <span class="mention GPE">Tunisia</span>'s <span class="mention TITLE">ambassador</span>, spoke to the <span class="mention GPE">American</span> <span class="mention TITLE">ambassador</span>.
  </li>

  <li><span class="mention DATE"><b>Date</b></span>: 
    <span class="mention DATE">July 9</span>, ... on <span class="mention DATE">Sunday</span>, ... in a statement <span class="mention DATE">last week</span>.
  </li>

  <li><span class="mention TITLE"><b>Title</b></span>: 
    ... the <span class="mention TITLE">head</span> of ruling party ..., 
    ... was elected <span class="mention TITLE">president</span>,
    ... said <span class="mention TITLE">Rev.</span> <span class="mention PER">Graylan Haglar</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
  <li> As you read through the text, try to <b>identify <i>named entities</i> (e.g. <b>Carrie Fisher</b>)</b> or any <b>references to named entities (e.g. <b>the star</b>)</b>, as well as <b>professional titles (e.g. actress)</b> and <b>dates (e.g. Thursday)</b>. 
    <i>You do not need to identify unnamed groups of people, e.g. <span style="color:gray">"Three policemen"</span>.
    </i>
    We've <span style="text-shadow: 0px 0px 1px black">bolded</span> spans which we guess might be useful, but we aren't that good and miss out on stuff. 
    <li>Select mentions using your mouse. <b>Different types of entity should be selected separately</b>, so in the phrase "Rev. Graylan Hagler", you should select <b>Rev.</b> (a title) separately from <b>Graylan Hagler</b> (a person).</li>
    <li> 
      If you <b>haven't</b> seen this entity in the text before, select its type via the <b> Add new entity </b> pane. 
      You may then be taken to a dialogue box for further processing. 
      <b>Only named people or organizations should be added as new entities</b> (e.g. you should highlight "<b>Shell Oil</b>" but not "<span class="color:gray"><i>Many oil companies</i></span>".)
    </li>
    <!--<li> Then you will be taken to a linking dialogue box where the task is to pick the matching <i>Wikipedia</i> entry if possible</li>-->
    <li> If you <b>have</b> seen this entity before then select it from <b> Select entities to link </b> panel. Indirect references to entities should be selected, (e.g. <b>"The company"</b>).</li>
    <li>
      Because documents vary in length, <b>we price each document differently</b> to try to pay you fairly. This amount and the expected time the document will take is listed on the top right.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3> Correcting mistakes </h3>
<ul>
  <li> If you feel you've made a mistake you can click on the incorrect span, the entity that you had selected would be highlighted.</li>
  <li> If it was only a matter of you having selected a wrong pre-existing entity, it can be fixed by selecting the right one this time. </li>
  <li> Otherwise, you can remove the span and redo the process correctly this time </li>
</ul>
<h3> Common mistakes </h3>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Creating a new entity instead of selecting an existing one</b>. To fix this mistake, click on the erroneous span and choose the existing entity from the list on the right.</li>
  <li> <b>Missing pronouns (e.g. she).</b></li>
  <li> <b>Including people's titles in with the name</b>, e.g. selecting "Speaker Paul Ryan" instead of "Speaker" and "Paul Ryan" separately. </li>
  <li> <b>Not looking at mentions that are not bolded</b>. </li>
</ol>
<h3> What is a title? </h3>
<p> Official or unofficial name(s) of the employment or membership positions that is held by someone. Here are a few examples </p>
<div class = 'row'>
  <div class = 'col-lg-6 text-success'> 
    <h4>Correct titles</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Doctor, Lawyer, Founder </li>
      <li> Chief Neurosurgeon, Associate Partner (the more specific, the better ;))</li>
  </div>
  <div class = 'col-lg-6 text-danger'> 
    <h4>Incorrect titles</h4>
    <li> Hero, Socialite</li>
    <li> "<span class='text-success'> reporter </span> with the LA Times" (no employer info required, just <span class='text-success'> reporter </span> is cool)</li>
  </div>

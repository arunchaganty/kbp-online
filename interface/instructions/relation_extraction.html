<p> First of all, welcome :) </p>
<p> 
The focus of this task is to identify relations between entities in the text
    A sentence in the text will be highlighted for you to consider. In that sentence, two entities will be colored.
    We would like you to identify how the red entity and blue entity are related, <i>according to the sentence</i>. It is also possible that they are unrelated.
    </p>
<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
    <li> Choose a relation that holds between the red and the blue entities from the buttons below. On hovering over the button you can see a preview of the relation between them. Make sure that this relationship makes sense and is justified by the sentence.</li>
    <li> After you make your choice, you'll be given the next pair of entities. </li>
    <li> Once all relations have been extracted you'll find the done button activated. </li>
</ol>

<h3> What you also see </h3>
<ol>
    <li> All extracted relations are shown in the right pane for your reference. If you made a mistake, click on them and correct it.</li>
    <li> If you missed a relation, press the back button to review.  </li>
</ol>
<h3> Common Pitfalls </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> If more than one relation seems to hold, pick the most appropriate one.  </li>
        </ul>

<p> First of all, welcome :) </p>
<p> The focus of this task is to find relations between entities in the text.<p>
<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
    <li> First you will be given mentions of two entities and the sentence containing these will be highlighted. </li>
    <li> You have to figure out if these mentions are related and if so then how. Note that relation should be explicitly mentioned within the given sentence.</li>
    <li> For the two highlighted entities possible relations are shown as buttons and hovering you can hover on them to verify if it sounds correct</li>
    <li> After you make the correct choice, you'll be given the next pair of entities</li>
</ol>

<h3> What you see </h3>
<ol>
    <li> All extracted relations are shown in the right pane for your reference. If you made a mistake, they can be clicked upon and edited </li>
    <li> It is also possible to go to previous pairs of mentions to correct them by pressing on Back button </li>
</ol>
<h3> Common Pitfalls </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> If more than one relation seems to hold, pick the most appropriate one.  </li>
        </ul>

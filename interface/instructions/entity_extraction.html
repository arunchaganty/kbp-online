<p> First of all, welcome :) </p>
<p> The focus of this task is to find mentions of entities in the given text. Entities can be people, organizations, places, dates or even titles given to people.<p>
<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
    <li> As you read through the text, see if a word or a span of words strikes you as mentioning an entity (even if it is a pronoun, or referring indrectly e.g. "The president said ..."). 
    <li> Upon finding a mention select it using your mouse (Even clicking on single words works ;)). We've bolded spans which we guess might be useful.</li>
    <li> If you've <i>never seen this entity</i> in the text before, select its type via the <b> Add new entity </b> pane </li>
    <li> Then you will be optionally taken to a linking dialogue box where the task is to pick the matching <i>Wikipedia</i> entry if possible</li>
    <li> If you <i> have seen this entity </i> then select the correct one from <b> Select entities to link </b> panel</li>

    <li> If you feel you've made a mistake you can click on the incorrect span and remove the span. The entity that you had selected would be highlighted. If it was only a matter of you having selected a wrong pre-existing entity, it can be fixed by selecting the right one this time. </li>
</ol>

<h3> Common mistakes </h3>
<ol>
    <li> It sometimes so happens that you end up creating a new entity instead of selecting one which we had already found. </li>
    <li> Pronouns are hard to miss. </li>
    <li> Titles of people and dates are easy to miss too. </li>
    <li> Our systems aren't great and sometimes we'll miss out on spans to bolden. Please teach us how to do it better. </li>
</ol>
<h3> What is a title? </h3>
<p> Official or unofficial name(s) of the employment or membership positions that is held by someone. Here are a few examples </p>
<div class = 'row'>
    <div class = 'col-lg-6 text-success'> 
        <h4>Correct titles</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Doctor, Lawyer, Founder </li>
            <li> Chief Neurosurgeon, Associate Partner (the more specific, the better ;)</li>
        </div>
        <div class = 'col-lg-6 text-danger'> 
            <h4>Incorrect titles</h4>
            <li> Hero, Socialite</li>
            <li> "<span class='text-success'> reporter </span> with the LA Times" (no employer info required, just <span class='text-success'> reporter </span> is cool)</li>
        </div>
    </div>

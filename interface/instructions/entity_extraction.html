<p> First of all, welcome :) </p>
<p>The focus of this task is to find mentions of entities in the given text. Entities can be people, organizations, places, dates or even titles given to people.
In these instructions, we talk about <b>common mistakes</b> and have an optional instructional video to help you understand the task better.

<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
  <li> As you read through the text, try to <b>identify <i>named entities</i> (e.g. <b>Carrie Fisher</b>)</b> or any <b>references to named entities (e.g. <b>the star</b>)</b>, as well as <b>professional titles (e.g. actress)</b> and <b>dates (e.g. Thursday)</b>. 
    <i>You do not need to identify unnamed groups of people, e.g. <span style="color:gray">"Three policemen"</span>.
    </i>
    We've <span style="text-shadow: 0px 0px 1px black">bolded</span> spans which we guess might be useful, but we aren't that good and miss out on stuff. 
    <li>Select mentions using your mouse. <b>Different types of entity should be selected separately</b>, so in the phrase "Rev. Graylan Hagler", you should select <b>Rev.</b> (a title) separately from <b>Graylan Hagler</b> (a person).</li>
    <li> 
    If you <b>haven't</b> seen this entity in the text before, select its type via the <b> Add new entity </b> pane. 
        You may then be taken to a dialogue box for further processing. 
        <b>Only named people or organizations should be added as new entities</b> (e.g. you should highlight "<b>Shell Oil</b>" but not "<span class="color:gray"><i>Many oil companies</i></span>".)
        </li>
        <!--<li> Then you will be taken to a linking dialogue box where the task is to pick the matching <i>Wikipedia</i> entry if possible</li>-->
        <li> If you <b>have</b> seen this entity before then select it from <b> Select entities to link </b> panel. Indirect references to entities should be selected, (e.g. "The company").</li>
    <li>
Because documents vary in length, <b>we price each document differently</b> to try to pay you fairly. This amount and the expected time the document will take is listed on the top right.
</li>

</ol>

<h3> Correcting mistakes </h3>
<ul>
    <li> If you feel you've made a mistake you can click on the incorrect span, the entity that you had selected would be highlighted.</li>
    <li> If it was only a matter of you having selected a wrong pre-existing entity, it can be fixed by selecting the right one this time. </li>
    <li> Otherwise, you can remove the span and redo the process correctly this time </li>
</ul>
<h3> Common mistakes </h3>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Creating a new entity instead of selecting an existing one</b>. To fix this mistake, click on the erroneous span and choose the existing entity from the list on the right.</li>
  <li> <b>Missing pronouns (e.g. she).</b></li>
  <li> <b>Including people's titles in with the name</b>, e.g. selecting "Speaker Paul Ryan" instead of "Speaker" and "Paul Ryan" separately. </li>
  <li> <b>Not looking at mentions that are not bolded</b>. </li>
</ol>
<h3> What is a title? </h3>
<p> Official or unofficial name(s) of the employment or membership positions that is held by someone. Here are a few examples </p>
<div class = 'row'>
    <div class = 'col-lg-6 text-success'> 
        <h4>Correct titles</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Doctor, Lawyer, Founder </li>
            <li> Chief Neurosurgeon, Associate Partner (the more specific, the better ;)</li>
        </div>
        <div class = 'col-lg-6 text-danger'> 
            <h4>Incorrect titles</h4>
            <li> Hero, Socialite</li>
            <li> "<span class='text-success'> reporter </span> with the LA Times" (no employer info required, just <span class='text-success'> reporter </span> is cool)</li>
        </div>
    </div>

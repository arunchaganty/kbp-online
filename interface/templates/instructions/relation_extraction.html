<p> First of all, welcome :) </p>
<p> 
The focus of this task is to <b>identify relationships between entities</b>, i.e. people, organizations, places, dates and job titles, in the article.
You will be shown a highlighted sentence with a <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">red</span> and a <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">blue</span> entity.
We would like you to <b>identify how the 
<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">red</span> and a <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">blue</span> entity
are related, <i>according to the highlighted sentence</i></b>.
It is also possible that they are unrelated or their relationship is not described in the highlighted sentence.
<b>Do not think about whether or not the two highlighted entities are related OUTSIDE this sentence</b>.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Consider the following example:
<blockquote>
  <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">British</span>
  prime minister <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">Tony Blair</span> addressed the gathering on Tuesday.
</blockquote>
We would mark <b>works for</b> because the sentence identifies <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">Tony Blair</span> to be a minister for <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">British.</span> (Britain). Marking the relation <b>lives at</b> would be <b>incorrect</b> because the sentence doesn't explicitly mention this fact.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, for,
<blockquote>
  Prime minister <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">Tony Blair</span> warned the public that some of those killed may be <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">British</span>.
</blockquote>
we would mark the two to be <b>unrelated</b> because this sentence does not explicitly say that <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">Tony Blair</span> and <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">British</span> (Britain) are related.
</p>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li> Choose a relation that holds between the red and the blue entities from the buttons below.
      On hovering over the button you can see a preview of the relation between them.
      Make sure that this relationship makes sense and is justified by the sentence.</li>
    <li> After you make your choice, you'll be given the next pair of entities. </li>
    <li> Once all relations have been extracted you'll find the done button activated. </li>
</ol>

<h3> What you also see </h3>
<ol>
    <li> All extracted relations are shown in the right pane for your reference.
      If you made a mistake, click on them and correct it.</li>
    <li> If you missed a relation, press the back button to review.  </li>
</ol>
<h3> Common Pitfalls </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> If more than one relation seems to hold, pick the most appropriate one.  </li>
            <li> A relation may be true in general, but if it is not justified by the sentence, then it should be marked unrelated.  </li>
        </ul>
